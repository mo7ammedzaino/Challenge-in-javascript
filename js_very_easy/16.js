Return the Remainder from Two Numbers
There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.

Examples
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0
Notes
The tests only use positive and negative integers.
Don't forget to return the result.

function remainder(x, y) {

}
